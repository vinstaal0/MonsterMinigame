						<div class="title"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></div>

						<div class="faq_left">
							<div class="faq_q">Does the game go on forever?</div>
							<div class="faq_a"><p>At 9am Pacific time each day, all game sessions in the Monster Summer Game will end. All players can then join a new game, beginning with attacking the level 1 enemies again. When you start a new game, you will start with special badge points that you can spend on abilities. The amount of badge points you get is based on the maximum boss level you’ve completed in the game on any previous day, plus the level of your Steam Summer Sale badge.</p>
								<p>The Monster Summer Game will be available to play until June 20th at 10am PDT.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="faq_q">Can I die in the game?</div>
							<div class="faq_a"><p>Yes, you have limited number of health points and the enemy monsters are doing damage to you. If your health points reach zero, you will die. Once dead, you can click to respawn in 5 seconds, or you will respawn automatically in five minutes--even when you are not signed in to Steam.</p></div>

							<div class="faq_q">Can I join a game that is already in progress?</div>
							<div class="faq_a"><p>When you click to start a game, you will be matched up with other players starting out at level 0. If you have a friend in an active game, you may join that game if you have previously achieved a similar level or higher than the game you are joining.</p></div>

						</div>


						<div class="faq_right">
							<div class="faq_q">What happens to the game when I close Steam?</div>
							<div class="faq_a"><p>Once you’ve joined a game session (which you accomplish by clicking the huge green ‘play now’ button near the top of this page) then you are in the game for the day unless you specifically choose to join a different game. While in a game, you will collect gold from any monster killed in your lane, whether you helped damage them or not.</p></div>

							<div class="faq_q">What is the Monster Summer Game badge?</div>
							<div class="faq_a"><p>Once you join a game session in the Monster Summer Game, you'll earn a new Monster Summer Game badge on your Steam profile. This badge will automatically level up to the highest boss level you’ve completed in the Monster Summer game.</p></div>

							<div class="faq_q">What does the Summer Sale badge and Monster Game badge get me?</div>
							<div class="faq_a"><p>Each level of your Summer Sale badge and each 10 levels of your Monster Game badge will get you a special Badge Point to spend when you start a Monster Summer Game. These points can be used to buy special abilities to help you and your team.</p></div>

					<div class="title"><span>More Frequently Asked Questions</span></div>

					<div class="faq_left">
						<div class="faq_q">What are trading cards?</div>
						<div class="faq_a"><p>Steam Trading Cards are virtual cards earned by buying and playing games on Steam that can be crafted into game badges that grant community rewards.</p>
							<p>Get an <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/">introduction to trading cards</a></p></div>

							<div class="faq_q">How do I get the Summer Sale badge?</div>
							<div class="faq_a"><p>Once you’ve collected the entire set of cards you can craft them into the Summer Sale badge to show off on your profile. From your Badges page, select a ready to craft badge to view its details and click on the blue 'Craft a Badge' button.</p>
								<p>View <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/my/badges/">your Summer Sale badge page</a></p></div>

								<div class="faq_q">What do I get when I craft the badge?</div>
								<div class="faq_a"><p>Crafting the Summer Sale badge earns you an emoticon and profile background. All rewards are tradable and marketable. Collecting and crafting another set of cards will level up your badge and earn you more items. Each time you craft a badge your Steam Level will also increase.</p></div>

								<div class="faq_q">And the foil badge?</div>
								<div class="faq_a"><p>Crafting the foil Summer Sale badge earns you extra Steam Level XP, plus an emoticon and profile background.</p></div>

								<div class="faq_q">What is unique to this badge?</div>
								<div class="faq_a"><p>During the sale there is no limit to the number of times you can upgrade this badge. The Summer Sale badge will drop a set of one emoticon and background each time you craft a new level.</p>
									<p>Unlike previous badges, once the sale ends the cards will disappear. Make sure to trade and craft your badges before June 22nd 10am PDT.</p></div>

									<div class="faq_q">Got more questions?</div>
									<div class="faq_a"><p>Check out the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq/">full Trading Cards FAQ</a></p></div>

								</div>

								<div class="faq_right">
									<div class="faq_q">How do I get Summer Sale trading cards?</div>
									<div class="faq_a"><p>Summer Sale trading cards are only available during the Monster Summer Sale. There are five ways to get the cards:</p></div>

									<div class="faq_subset">
										<div class="faq_q first">Craft a game badge</div>
										<div class="faq_a"><p>Starting June 1st, crafting a game badge earned you a Summer Sale trading card rather than a coupon, so if you crafted a badge in the last week you’re already ahead of the game. During the sale, each game badge you craft will get you an additional Summer Sale trading card.</p></div>

										<div class="faq_q">Make a purchase</div>
										<div class="faq_a"><p>As an extra reward for purchasing, for every $10 USD spent during the sale, you’ll receive a Summer Sale trading card. From your Summer Sale badge page select “How do I get more cards?” to track your purchasing progress.</p></div>

										<div class="faq_q">Play the Monster Summer Game</div>
										<div class="faq_a"><p>If you’re Steam Level 8 and above, you’ll get a Summer Sale trading card at random intervals while playing, up to three per 24-hour period. (If you reach Steam Level 8 before the end of the sale, you’ll be granted the cards you earned by playing the Monster Summer Game).</p></div>

										<div class="faq_q">Trade for them</div>
										<div class="faq_a"><p>That’s why they’re called trading cards! Find friends with other cards and make trades. Your Monster Card badge page shows which friends have the cards you need.</p></div>

										<div class="faq_q">Buy them from the Community Market</div>
										<div class="faq_a"><p>Sell the cards you don’t need and buy the ones you do, all with other Community members. Turn those duplicate cards into Steam Wallet funds to buy games.</p>
											<p>View the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/market/">Community market</a>.</p></div>

									<div class="title"><span>Credits &amp; Acknowledgements</span></div>
									<p>As you can probably tell from the style of the summer game, we’ve been kind of obsessed with a few clicker games that have become popular. It started a while ago with Cookie Clicker, then with <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/">AdVenture Capitalist</a> and more recently with <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/363970/">Clicker Heroes</a> (which has roughly 56 Trillion players on Steam). The Monster Summer Game is a bit of an homage to those clicker games as well as old pixel artwork from generations of past favorites.</p>
									<p>With the Monster Summer Game, we're also trying to take the opportunity to highlight as many of the great titles available on Steam as we can. One of the ways we're doing this is by utilizing the Steam Emoticons provided by a few titles and using them as ability icons within the Monster Summer Game. If you're interested in learning more about the games behind these icons, check out the list here.</p>
